description:
  Synopsys DesignWare Enhanced uMCTL2 DDR Memory Controller is capable of
  working with the memory devices supporting up to (LP)DDR4 protocol. It can
  be equipped with SEC/DEC ECC feature if DRAM data bus width is either
  16-bits or 32-bits or 64-bits wide.

    description:
      DW uMCTL2 DDRC IP-core provides individual IRQ signal for each event":"
      ECC Corrected Error, ECC Uncorrected Error, ECC Address Protection,
      Scrubber-Done signal, DFI Parity/CRC Error. Some platforms may have the
      signals merged before they reach the IRQ controller or have some of them
      absent in case if the corresponding feature is unavailable/disabled.
