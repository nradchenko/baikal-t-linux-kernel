title: Synopsys DesignWare Ethernet PCS Management Interface

description:
  Synopsys DesignWare Ethernet PCS provides an interface between MAC and PMA
  through the Media Independent Interface. The PCS CSRs can be accessible over
  the Ethernet MDIO bus or directly by means of the APB3/MCI interfaces. In the
  later case the XPCS can be mapped right to the system IO memory space.

          DW XPCS CSRs space can be either 'directly' or 'indirectly'
          accessible. In the former case all Clause 45 registers are
          contiguously mapped within the address space MMD '[20:16]',
          Reg '[15:0]'. In the later case the space is divided to the
          multiple 256 register sets. There is a special viewport CSR
          which is responsible for the set selection. The upper part of
          the CSR address is supposed to be written in there thus the
          corresponding subset would be mapped over the lowest 255 CSRs.

      The way the CSRs are mapped to the memory is platform depended. Since
      each Clause 45 CSR is of 16-bits wide the access instructions must be
