description:
  Synopsys DesignWare Ethernet Physical Coding Sublayer provides an interface
  between Media Access Control and Physical Medium Attachment Sublayer through
  the Media Independent Interface (XGMII, USXGMII, XLGMII, GMII, etc)
  controlled by means of the IEEE std. Clause 45 registers set. The PCS can be
  optionally synthesized with a vendor-specific interface connected to
  Synopsys PMA (also called DesignWare Consumer/Enterprise PHY) although in
  general it can be used to communicate with any compatible PHY.
